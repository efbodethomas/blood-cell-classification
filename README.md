# Blood Cell Image Classification using Machine Learning
This project involves a dataset of blood cell images containing four different cell types - Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil. The objective of this project is to train a machine learning classifier to accurately classify the different cell types using the provided blood cell images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of blood cell images in the PNG format. The dataset contains a total of [insert number of images] images, with [insert number of images] images for each of the four different cell types.

## Approach
In order to classify the blood cell images, we will use a machine learning algorithm that is capable of learning the distinguishing features of each cell type. We will start by preprocessing the images to ensure they are in a suitable format for training the classifier. We will then train the machine learning model using the preprocessed images and evaluate its performance using a variety of metrics.

## Tools Used
Python
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to accurately classify different types of blood cells using their images. With further development and refinement, this technology could potentially be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of blood cell analysis in medical settings.
